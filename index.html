    <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am an incoming Lecturer of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yuejiec/index.html">Dr. Yuejie Chi</a>. 
            I received my B.S.E. with Honors in <a href="https://ecee.engineering.asu.edu/">Electrical Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a> with a Minor in Mathematics. 
        </p>

        <p>
            While at CMU, I was the sole recipient of the <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/student-resources/commencement-awards.html">Oustanding ECE Teaching Assistant Award</a> for the 2018-2019 Academic Year for my contributions to 18-290 Signals and Systems in Fall 2018 and 18-202 Mathematical Foundations of Electrical Engineering in Spring 2019. 
            In the future, I am motivated to teach future generations the beauty of machine learning and signal processing.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am additionally interested in mentoring students on their research endeavors.  
            My research interests lie in the domain of designing and analyzing efficient algorithms for solving inverse problems--especially within the realm of image reconstruction--which improve upon the computational and statistical performance of state-of-the-art methods.
