            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Vince Monardo is an incoming Lecturer of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He completed his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, where he was advised by Dr. Yuejie Chi. Vince received his BSE with Honors in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State University with a Minor in Mathematics. Vince's research interests lie in the domain of designing and analyzing efficient algorithms for solving inverse problems--especially within the realm of image reconstruction--which improve upon the computational and statistical performance of state-of-the-art methods. In the future, Vincent is motivated to teach future generations the beauty of machine learning and signal processing.
While at CMU, Vince was the sole recipient of the Oustanding ECE Teaching Assistant Award for the 2018-2019 Academic Year for his contributions to 18-290 Signals and Systems and 18-202 Mathematical Foundations of Electrical Engineering.  </p>
